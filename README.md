## 📝 **About the Project**
- **What is it for?**
  It's to create yourself an awesome bio, to show off things like your socials. 
- **Why did you create it?**  
- I created this because I had seen other people creating their own bio's, buying domains,
  and hosting them so I thought it would be a fun project for me.
